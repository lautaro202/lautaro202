### I'm Lautaro, welcome to my GitHub
 Passionate about music and technology.

   I am looking for my first work experience in the IT field, while I continue to learn and
training me.

   I am responsible, creative and I like the challenge of constantly improving myself all the time.
   I like being a Front End developer, because it is my job to make the cover letter of a page, it is the first impression you get, which I can be able to offer you with just a glance. I would like to give all users a good impression on every job I do

Front End projects, i love them. I like being a Front End developer, because it is my job to make the cover letter of a page, it is the first impression you get, which I can be able to offer you with just a glance. I would like to give all users a good impression on every job I do
