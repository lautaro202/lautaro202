### I'm Lautaro, welcome to my GitHub
 Passionate about music and technology.

   I am looking for my first work experience in the IT field, while I continue to learn and
training me.

   I am responsible, creative and I like the challenge of constantly improving myself all the time.
   I like being a Front End developer, because it is my job to make the cover letter of a page, it is the first impression you get, which I can be able to offer you with just a glance. I would like to give all users a good impression on every job I do
  
### - ðŸŒ± What are my skills?
In 2020 I started the Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp at Henry. With + 600HS I learned the following technologies in depth: 
- GIT 
- HTML5 
- CSS3 (Flexbox / Bootstrap / Less) 
- JavaScript (ES6) 
- React (Class / Hooks) 
- Redux
 - NodeJS 
- Express 
- Sequelize 
- PostgreSQL 
- Testing 
- AXIOS 
- Agile SCRUM Methodologies
